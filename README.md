Reverse Shell/File Transfer Application

This is an appliation used to inject or retrive files as well as run commands on a remote target.
This started as a quick way to trasnfer files from my VMs and main Desktop, as well as access and navigate 
through their directory system. The IPs are stll static as well as encryption keys, so to the program both IPs 
must be configured prior running. 

Adjust the server address to the interface you want it to bind, and the client to the server's addresss.

Have fun!
